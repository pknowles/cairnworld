# User Excerpts

Direct quotes that clarify design intent, too fine-grained for
user_declarations.md. Newest last.

## Chat history is the primary data, not a recording feature

> We just need LLM chat histories to exist somewhere. Not in some "recording
> backend" - in the regular flow of the game/database. Then we need an
> implicit way to reconstruct it.

> We will implicitly need to store chat histories so that the game works.
> Likely as separate messages/inference results.

Recording is a property of storing messages and assembling context, not a
layer added on top of inference.

## Failed inferences are recorded and visible

> Failed inference will be very interesting to capture. It should appear in
> the chat history as a failed output - definitely in the developer chat
> history - and be clickable and we need to be able to properly reconstruct
> the prompt that produced it.

## Design must follow the declarations

> I didn't write design.md. I wrote the user definitions. Design must be
> based on the user definitions and if there's a conflict it's your job to
> raise it (in case I'm the one that's wrong) and then fix it so that
> everything matches user declarations.

On the abstraction this rule was introduced to prevent:

> The problem was we were implementing some abstract recording concept that
> was totally unnecessary just to satisfy the plan. There was a disconnect
> between what was being implemented and what was implicitly required by
> user_declarations.md.

## Remove wrong-direction code outright

> I would prefer the bad code be removed entirely.

The biggest risk of leaving it is that a later agent reads it and makes bad
assumptions.
